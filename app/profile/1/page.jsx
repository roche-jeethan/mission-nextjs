        This is a simple React component named <code>Page</code>. It renders a <code>div</code> element containing a heading and a paragraph. The styling is powered by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. The heading is made prominent with a larger font size and bold weight, while the paragraph provides additional information with a subtle gray color. This setup demonstrates the ease of integrating Tailwind CSS with React for styling components.
